    <StargateMod_MakeOrlinStargate.description>An portal able to connect to the ley-line network and use it to transport people or resources between nexus points. This arcane portal in particular was made using easily available resources, but is quite unstable and unreliable, and also requires an external energy source. It is both too weak and too small to have a protective arcane barrier attached. It has an integrated control crystal. Make sure to get out of the way before it finishes attuning...\n"You wouldn't believe the things that you can make from the common, simple items lying around your planet."</StargateMod_MakeOrlinStargate.description>
